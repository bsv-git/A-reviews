They can not explain what happened so they tell you a bunch of stuff over and over again to try to placate you without ever solving your issues because they they don't actually know why it happened. So instead of diving into the issue they say it was your banks or card that was at fault. I called my bank and was told Amazon never even attempted to charge my card.
