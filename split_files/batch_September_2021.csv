ad8bf3be-1854-4606-85cc-2536bc545d49,John Hawkinson,"Generally OK, but the ""My orders"" part is super flaky. ¶ Feature showing the driver's location is really cool, but SO FLAKY. Lately it shows me a map that is .75"" high on my 5"" screen, a mini postage-stamp -high strip. Above it there's ""Now arriving today"" and a picture of the item, and below it is…supposed to be the Update dlivery instructions/Share tracking buttons, but actually I just see all blank whitespace. If I scroll up (losing the map), then those buttons properly paint. So…bad refresh logic. Galaxy S7 Android 8.0.0. ¶ Notifications on package delivery are inconsistent. Since nobody rings the doorbell anymore, I feel like thieves can steal the package in the 30-60 minutes it takes to get a notification that the package is delivered. ¶ It's slow to get to your orders (click on the ""person"" icon, takes 10 seconds, then Your Orders takes another few). ¶ Track Shipment, See all Updates is too many clicks, with attendant slowness between. ¶ It's annoying to refresh. Should be able to pull down instead of going back twice and then going to See all Updates again. ¶ Should be able to Swipe Left/Right between items in the Shipment details screen, but you can't.

I tap multiple times, and it takes 4+ seconds to respond. I use the list functionality a lot, and it's functioned poorly on this app for as long as I can recall. To add 10 individual items to lists, takes a very long time.
