6f681a76-e1d8-445c-a0de-b7f03e6b9e90,A Google user,There is always something wrong with this app. The latest problem I've had for over a month an Amazon Tech can't seem to resolve it. I have called and emailed them with all the info they have asked for. It took several emails over several days for them to say they understood my problem but I don't think they ever did understand it. The problem I have is when I try to access the vendor list for used DVDs. Only DVDs no other items. Still not fixed after a month !!!!!,1,1,16.12.0.100,2020-02-18 18:46:44,16.12.0.100

Only viewing about a dozen items per page is absolutely dysfunctional. If you filter by going low to high or vice versa, it actually reduces the number of items that are viewable to less than a third of what they were by not filtering at all. That's just redundant to have the number of items viewable to change at all by simply filtering low to high or vice versa",1,3,16.17.0.100,2020-02-16 19:15:49,16.17.0.100
