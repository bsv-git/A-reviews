After supplying video evidence of the incident which I received from a neighbor. They still refuse to fully pay for the repair of a new mailbox and it's installation.

I've ordered things that have gone out of stock while waiting for them to ship even though I've already ordered resulting in ridiculous delivery times. Two items got pushed back so much that the delivery date I was given ended up being a month after expected delivery WITH prime and they don't honor their late delivery policy.

Says suspicious activity yet customer service can't find anything wrong. It takes several pages of nonsense to even find the customer service number.

7cef9e1c-4ca0-4c9f-a3af-25092854dad9,Chris Henry,What happened to dark mode? The app is fine but where did dark mode go? You had it then you updated it and now it seems impossible to find. There's nothing on app settings and if you Google it it tells you to go and change your phone settings to dark mode and that will force the app to go to dark mode. That does not happen. Please bring it back.,3,0,30.1.0.100,2025-01-18 00:27:34,30.1.0.100

5c4595fc-dd5c-4bb5-81b9-b62fc4cd2f5a,Amy Gregory,I live on Amazon Shopping!!!! My first response to someone asking me where I think they can buy something is to say have you looked on Amazon? I am on Amazon Shopping at least once a day just to look at what is trending or what is on special pricing that day. I also LOVE that I can buy gifts for family and friends no matter where they live and have it shipped directly to them with a gift message from me and email them a copy of a gift receipt incase they want a different size or color. ❤️ Amazon,5,0,28.23.2.100,2025-01-01 15:17:27,28.23.2.100

249ec9ca-6cc4-46d9-914e-fe58b5f59359,Mandy Coffelt,Awful company. EVERYTIME I order from Amazon there is some kind of issue. The last time I ordered from them was over a year ago. I never got my package. Customer service was no help at all. Well now they are trying to get over on me big time. First it was the delivery date of January 11th. I ordered this 5 days ago. I'm a prime member. Now I'm locked out of my account and customer service is zero help. Other than telling me it will take 48hrs to email me a form to fill out so I can prove I'm me,1,0,28.23.2.100,2025-01-01 13:09:13,28.23.2.100

c579dc59-fe32-4d79-bd20-cd2c4f75c64d,Dean Wallace,Amazon Prime is garbage now. Delivery windows are straight up lies; some products take over a week to arrive (days past their promised delivery date); some popular books have delivery windows a month out; customer sercice is a joke; I've been waiting three weeks for a $13 refund on a return I made to a local Amazon Fresh store; and many returns now require you to print and package your own return. Costco and Walmart+ are far more reliable -- and worth their membership fees.,1,0,28.23.2.100,2025-01-01 09:26:43,28.23.2.100

On 2oth their system changed my billing card to a non existent card. ""Sir your order will be delayed 7 days"". Really? Ok fine. 28th delivery I'm told I canceled my order. Who waits this long to cancel, and on the day of delivery? Doesn't happen. Now I'm told Jan 7th. I'm so thankful I'm only on trial, I've been promised dates, discounts, refunds.
