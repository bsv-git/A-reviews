Everything is AI when you need help and there's some things you need help with and without waiting for hours. A driver has been leaving packages in the totally and obviously wrong place. I have tried to contact a human to get this resolved because I literally watched the driver put packages under the address indicator instead of apartment doors. I have the videos and I have my apartment number on my address for items and my neighbor does too.,2,0,30.9.0.100,2025-05-13 10:14:32,30.9.0.100

527376a9-721d-4c2c-91ed-1cfd13170420,Phoenix,I'm done with Amazon. This is the second time this app has screwed me over. Last time my account was hacked and I couldn't even delete the account. Had to create a new account and now I can't sign in. Customer service is a joke. They keep giving me the same answer: wait 24 hours and try again but the problem has not been solved. I don't think anyone should ever use this app. I'm done. Deleting and using literally any other shopping app available. You've lost my business.,1,0,28.13.6.100,2025-05-04 04:46:33,28.13.6.100
