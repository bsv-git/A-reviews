I downloaded the app and almost immediately my phone began to glitch out. Sometimes I would open Google and Amazon would open instead. The ad blockers I have installed stopped working, and my phone would stop receiving or making calls when the app was active. My solution in the end was a factory reset, and the issues stopped.
