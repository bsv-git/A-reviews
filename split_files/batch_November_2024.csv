I have added up the items cost plus the estimated tax collected and my total is always $0.29 less than the total they billed me for. On every order. 100 orders = $29 stolen.

When I get a notification that a delivery will be late, they tell you you can cancel and get a refund, however... There is NO option to do so. Stop advertising same day delivery when it's 2 days late. Don't tell me I'll get it today, then all of a sudden it's ""now expected tomorrow by 10 pm"".

Approaching senior management got me a bit more refund but they all ignored the root problem and no investigation as they promised, so basically their staff are given free reign to abuse customers and keep abusing them as no real change has actually taken place.

I contact chat customer services and get told its because payment is pending. This didnt make sense as i purchased items the previous day.
