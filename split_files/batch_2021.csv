It's extremely difficult to search products by a specific category since many of them are burried deep inside other less relevant categories. Filtering is also a mess. There's no way to choose a specific price range and/or multiple brands. In addition, it's impossible to leave the seller's feedback after purchasing(!).

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! Amazon started as an online retailer, but has evolved into something too large for everyone's own good. They became a manufacturer of hardware, they are now involved with the news media and even web hosting. The final straw for me was when they decided that they need Section 230 protections, but they want to deny those same protections to others. While we are using their services and hardware they are collecting more information about the user than we realize all in an effort to control what we see and determine for us what is acceptable.
