d9d37447-d68d-490d-9216-c69af65967de,_,Amazon has got so horrible at being a retailer. No one is making sure things are packed right so things get broken on the way to the house. Even though Amazon claims they don't put returns back on the Shelf so to speak I get an item that's completely open with fingerprints all over it. I only have so much room here in this review so I'll leave it at that but I would highly recommend looking elsewhere to buy your items.,1,1,26.1.2.100,2023-01-11 19:17:33,26.1.2.100

They do not care about patients and they make empty promises about when your prescription will arrive. They just keep pushing the date out further. You can't go out of town or make reservations to go away because yours meds will never arrive in time. You will run out before they ever fill the prescription. Most of the so called pharmacists work from HOME. It was a deadly mistake to allow Amazon to sell anything other that electronic toys.,1,0,26.23.0.100,2023-12-18 07:05:09,26.23.0.100

The parcels shows in the Amazon Account as delivered/handed over to the customer (me) but never have had happened. Nothing. How in the name you deliver something without a document ID to proof as the parcel it is in the right hands?
