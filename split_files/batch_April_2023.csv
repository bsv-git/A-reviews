ca9826f2-b4cc-4946-a804-ddacb2647972,Jeffrey Nichtberger,I was having the same app breaking issues for a year that others were reporting. Like how the only buttons that would work were Home & Cart and the rest was unusable. The app even crashes on launch on the latest version. But all the issues I was having resolved after clearing the app data first (and it still somehow auto signed me in afterwards)! Seems like they broke associations with past app data at some point. I strongly recommend you try resetting the app first too if you're having issues.,3,0,24.10.2.100,2023-04-05 05:56:57,24.10.2.100
