If I search for something in one of my lists and accidentally hit the wrong item to browse I'll hit the back button and instead of going back to my space it takes me all the way back to the top.

I rarely leave reviews on products (which isn't very cool of me as I depend on other people's reviews so much) but it is unbelievable to me that a company as large & as wealthy as Amazon can't make a decent app that doesn't crash constantly!!

For example - I frequently tell Alexa to shuffle my music for all-inclusive use of all my playlists. If I had a Christmas playlist, I would have to listen to Christmas music all year, which is strictly against my music code. On Spotify you can create a playlist and it wont add to the main list of music unless you tell it to. Please change this!",3,28,18.18.0.100,2019-09-19 02:34:47,18.18.0.100
