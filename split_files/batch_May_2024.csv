Then the supervisor on the phone treats you like an idiot and again lies to you then hangs up on you lol,1,1,28.10.0.100,2024-05-29 02:27:11,28.10.0.100

I'm severely disabled & can't work. #Amazon provides an amazing marketplace where I can get my basic necessities delivered directly to my apt. The app is very comprehensive & intuitive. One can manage pretty much everything from there. My only constructive feedback is that contacting a human support CS rep is difficult. Too many prompts & questions.

b3539712-3441-47b8-9a27-d84c22f06dac,Dan S,This is the Jesus's you all pray to review. The sight is OK easy to use. Alot of desperate others who aren't satisfying any partner or have anything real and it shows. Like the owner. The subscribe and save should have a total amount. Showing before you pay. They removed a button that go's straight to your purchases. That should be back. Overall it's OK. But it does say I don't like filthy rich people.They lack so much. then use money to counterbalance the stuff within. - Daniel speights,2,1,28.7.0.100,2024-05-22 09:58:08,28.7.0.100
