I remember when studying for UI/UX design, one of the website layouts that we would see A/B (before/after) was Amazon's since they were the industry's leaders of e-commerce layouts. Many sites were modeled after theirs since it was set up the best! So they decide to change that? Why? To force people to accept the change as if it were necessary? When it wasn't at all! Also I hate their new(ish) app icon, it's awful. Amazon should be the BEST. Fire your staff",2,1,,2021-08-03 11:21:30,
