Developer in Google LLC is updating all my apps bypassing Play Store updates. this developer has destroyed 22 devices in the last year+ some. any app installed in my device is at the developers control and not my control. today I purchased my 23rd device and I am hoping this doesn't cause your site any problems but the developer becomes a developer in all apps that are installed by this developer group.,1,0,,2025-09-14 02:39:55,
ce030ab5-597d-4eb9-8d35-5f675c8117e8,Jeffrey Clement,Amazon gets one star for implementing the reseller program. I can't buy an overpriced yeti cozy selling for over 30$ because someone bought all of them and sells them for over 100$. stop this reseller garbage and let us buy the things we need and want at real prices. instead of lazy resellers ruining our lives. and due to my review Amazon is bullying me by blocking my account. just beware that they are more interested in stealing your dollar than protecting its clients from scams.,1,214,30.17.0.100,2025-09-14 02:08:11,30.17.0.100

It seems that sellers & Amazon both have a problem with shipping dates. You order- it gives you the time frame you're supposed to receive the package and then it's always late. I mean 2-3 days late sometimes. So therefore I stopped ordering items that I need in a day or 2 from amazon- it ain't happening any way! DISAPPOINTING!!!,3,0,,2025-09-12 01:20:32,
