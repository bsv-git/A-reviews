You Ruined searches. 20 sponsored items before I see anything relevant. Fake sales. Most prices are inflated then lowered for a sale. The influencer live videos are horrible. I want to disable these QVC knockoffs from auto-playing. You make it difficult to delete search history and search bar.

I have to wait for a message from Amazon in my email saying my order was canceled. After that I have to put place items in new cart and update payment method which was the same method as I was using before. This is time consuming and makes no sense.

Sometimes I don't need anything but I get charged for it especially when I don't get anything. It should be like if I want to pay a little bit more for two days versus a week or a month. Then I would be considering doing that. But I don't see no reason why I should have to pay for something that I don't use every week.,4,0,28.5.2.100,2024-06-13 05:04:03,28.5.2.100

But you'll have to get on the phone with them to even let them screw you over this badly. Their competitors don't even conduct themselves this poorly. If you're going to do business with them. Make sure that you are certain about your order and aren't just casually shopping. They aren't in the business of giving your money back.,2,0,28.11.2.100,2024-06-12 21:16:13,28.11.2.100

It just displays a side panel saying the thing you clicked on for .2 seconds. The web site redirects to the app, so the app effectively blocks purchases from Amazon from your phone.

Most of the screen gets taken up by rufus asking if I have any questions and Rufus pops up every 5 seconds. When I fo have a question Rufus isn't able to provide an answer. Wish there was some way to turn off Rufus AI so it isn't constantly bothering me asking if I have questions when I'm just trying to browse.,1,2,28.11.2.100,2024-06-10 16:43:32,28.11.2.100
