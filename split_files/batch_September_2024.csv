Every other order I place gets cancelled/delayed by Amazon. Even changed delivery method to Whole Foods. I actually really needed this last item I ordered within the prime window or I would have gone to brick and mortar. This was the final straw for me. Be honest and realistic with your customers about delivery times. Change prime delivery window to 4 to 5 days.,1,0,28.18.0.100,2024-09-22 09:56:47,28.18.0.100

2d98db78-7e6d-4e41-a787-fba46c4434e1,Jeramy Hall,Amazon started blocking features like screenshots and allowing phone assistants interact with what's on the screen (like selecting and copying text). If Amazon is worried about screenshots they should focus on what's causing them to be worried about it instead of blocking a basic phone function.,1,1,28.17.0.100,2024-09-16 00:42:15,28.17.0.100

Anazon only gives access to.food stamps. Does not find cash on the card. Cash is the same as food stamps on EBT. Ishop Walmart because wWalmart has the option. Thiscis a problem with amazon not just the app. Can't do it on the web either,1,0,28.16.0.100,2024-09-15 17:09:09,28.16.0.100

When I had Amazon Prime item arent always delivered it time quoted. When Prime is purchased the delivery dates are very seldom real. Delivery dates are most of the time late. I'm better off saving the 14.99 and paying for the shipment. Amazon does do a good job when asking for a refund for poor quality or broken items. quality is seldom Amazon's fault.,3,1,28.17.0.100,2024-09-07 15:49:52,28.17.0.100

b8d2a433-d07c-4732-9af9-475ecb6423f8,Devon,Fantastic. So user friendly and the layout is attractive! The UI makes sense and responds with 0 hiccups. Love it. Updated to 2 stars: I can't find a simple hook magnet of decent pulling strength because literally anything you search for these days is flooded with cheap Chinese alternatives. Literally blatantly lying about product capabilities. You can't find a quality name brand product anymore because Amazon is drowning in clones sold by multiple parties without *country of origin* listed. ⚖️,2,2,28.16.0.100,2024-09-07 15:14:47,28.16.0.100

So I put in for a replacement order so now they want me to go out of my way and send the stuff back. so the replacement order is put in and I call Amazon letting them know the situation to which they told me to keep or donate the items and they will send my replacement order. Then Sunday my original package arrives and Monday the replacement order arrives and they charged me twice,2,3,28.16.0.100,2024-09-05 15:58:31,28.16.0.100
