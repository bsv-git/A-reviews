bcec5d53-83e7-43e0-9b06-bccfcf64b7c0,Michael L,I'm updating this but keeping it at three stars. For a time I noticed a really great feature in the app where you could check or uncheck items in your cart so that you didn't have to buy your entire cart and didn't have to put things in the save for later list. This feature has now somehow disappeared. I found it to be an extremely useful feature and would be very happy if it was brought back,3,63,26.19.4.100,2023-10-19 17:44:50,26.19.4.100

Its eliminating results rather than just sorting price from low to high!ALSO it's very irritating because you constantly have to re-do your search filter/preference!

The website has had that functionality forever. Is very handy when you want to split payments across different payment methods or need to split things up for multiple invoices.

Since then, they authorized ANOTHER charge for the same amount, taking funds I needed. I contacted support, said they'd release the hold in 3-5 days. Could do it immediately, but they choose not to. Absolutely ridiculous. I contacted my bank, who released the hold for me so I actually have gas money now to go to work. Bffr, Amazon. Billion$ company having that kind of audacity is laughable. Never again.",1,0,26.19.4.100,2023-10-05 23:22:57,26.19.4.100
