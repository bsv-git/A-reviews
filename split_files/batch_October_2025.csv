So many scammers online these days and Amazon can't be serious about keeping their customers details secure or having one actually have power over a scammer that could potentially be trying to use a browser to dupe people believing it's an Amazon text message and a suspicious link for a delivery.

f276c742-5159-42b7-99c4-fdcc3055677d,I Am The Cheese,"not so much the app, I mean it's still Amazon. but Amazon itself is circling the drain in customer service. why offer overnight shipping or two day if they're just going to ship it at their leisure anyway without any sort of beholden to the ""guarantee""? ""qualifying"" for next day delivery means very little when it still ships 2 or 3 days later anyway. if I had known it wouldn't ship on time anyway I could've just opted for the ""green"" option and gotten the extra credit.",2,0,30.16.0.100,2025-10-01 01:29:47,30.16.0.100

Ridiculous amount of time to get through the automated service to an actual representative. Then, once talking to a representative, even longer wait times. It usually takes a total of 30 minutes or more each call. ALSO, constant delays in shipping items!!!",4,0,30.18.0.100,2025-10-01 00:38:11,30.18.0.100
