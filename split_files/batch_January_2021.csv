The search results don't always list the categories in the filters, making browsing the app harder. I can't move items from one wishlist to another without the app crashing, so onto the actual website for that.

They can not find all the mysterious charges anyone with a long relationship with Amazon has. It is all outsourced so language is a problem. Their prices fluctuate so much depending on who you get, they don't always grant price adjustments even if the item is within a return period. (I once got denied a USD $0.50 adjustment, so I sent it back, and bought it again. So much for being pro-environment.)",1,96,22.1.0.100,2021-01-09 18:29:24,22.1.0.100
