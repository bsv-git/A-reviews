They do not care about patients and they make empty promises about when your prescription will arrive. They just keep pushing the date out further. You can't go out of town or make reservations to go away because yours meds will never arrive in time. You will run out before they ever fill the prescription. Most of the so called pharmacists work from HOME. It was a deadly mistake to allow Amazon to sell anything other that electronic toys.,1,0,26.23.0.100,2023-12-18 07:05:09,26.23.0.100
