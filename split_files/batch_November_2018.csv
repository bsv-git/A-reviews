This might be due to issues with signal when making orders but I've now been charged for multiple extra items I don't need and that I can no longer receive due to where they were shipped to.

For the last month I had it installed, every 2nd launch would greet me with a screen prompting me to sign up for Prime. Were it a marketing message, it would simply be annoying. However, someone chose to wrap their marketing in a cheap ploy to get users to accidentally sign up for Prime. The ad praises Prime's virtues, while implying that turning down the option is a poor choice. The options are presented using buttons that mesh with standard GUIs that users are accustomed to, with the yes option pre-highlighted. It would be all too easy to simply breeze by something that seems like another plain old marketing message, tap the first option, and not realise that one had signed up. Combined with the patronising wording of the ad, I am very much not inclined to allow this app on my phone.
