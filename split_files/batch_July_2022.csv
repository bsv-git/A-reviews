Their quick to take your money but slow at refunding. I recently found out by mouth if u return electronics it can take up to one month to get your money bs let it b known 1st b4 anything. It doesn't say that when u request a refund it's clearly tells u once they receive the item u can get the gift card which takes 2 to 4 hrs or regular method 7 days.

I am done shopping on Amazon I am tired of losing my money and my orders being damaged or not delivered and delivered to the wrong city. Amazon has no rights saying once the package leaves the warehouse they are not responsible. That is a lie Amazon commits theft the driver's steals people's packages so I hope people think twice about shopping with these thieve clowns l. Items shipped by Amazon is amazon's responsibility to fix any issues and with there delivery driver's.,1,1,24.12.6.100,2022-07-26 05:16:37,24.12.6.100
