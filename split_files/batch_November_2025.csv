Not only did they not come but they simply just moved the delivery date and didn't tell me.

0342eb86-31ac-4be5-84e2-42678c893a4a,Brandon Whitten,complete trash of a app. always says oops sorry. go back home. you would think a billion dollar company would have dev techs that knew what they was doing. and now two times in a row tells me a package is gonna be delivered today. well no its not. its gonna go back to the warehouse and sit for 4 days I'll have to call again to see what is going on. temu might rake longer to get but guess what you get it when they say you are,1,0,30.19.0.100,2025-11-01 03:15:25,30.19.0.100

30470cf6-9eca-451a-bf7f-af3841971631,Emily E.,"Amazon used to be amazing with it's delivery time, but recently, I ordered a figure during September and it said that it would be delivered either October 15 or the 14 or maybe September 14 or 15. It is now the end of October and still no sign of it even being shipped. There were only a few figures available, and I get that it would take time, so the app said that they would send an email for when it'll be shipped and when it'll arrive. Still haven't got an email.",1,0,30.20.0.100,2025-11-01 01:39:08,30.20.0.100
