Amazon is trying so hard to be everything they forget the one thing that was helpful. Same with Amazon Music...they removed the Genre grouping in that app. I don't want to be sold something...I want to search for something to buy. The app is just as horrible as their delivery service these days. I now buy more product locally than in the past 10 years...it is less frustrating.,1,1,,2021-12-12 10:50:54,
