There are other reasons that people want password protection from purchases. There's so many monthly services that you can accidentally get a free trial and later on you're charged and don't even realize it. Just not user friendly.

Now customer service is scripted to inform you that PRIME means when it leaves the local facility it will be to you in two days after that.
