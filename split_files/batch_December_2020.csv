Prioritizes loading recommended products and similar item images over the product I actually want images to load for; Chrome does not do this. Will be loading a page, almost to completion, then give you a picture of a dog and an ""oops"" or ""something went wrong"" message. Chrome doesn't do this. Eats my battery! Uses less battery to just browse amazon using Chrome browser. Overall, for maybe the richest company in the world, this is a subpar application.

It keeps crashing when I keep trying to move items that accidently went to the wrong list or deleting items that are no longer available. The individual sort feature is annoying too. If you make a new catagory and want to mass move items you have to spend a long time moving each item individually. I like using the apps buy again feature.

Ordered a christmas present on December 8th. Said it was shipped on the 10th. Now the 22nd and still no delivery. Can't get a hold of this delivery company. Only voicemail . Says on the 14th the package is in town. So where is it!!! Waiting 14 days and still not here. Telling me if I don't get it by the 23rd to get a refund. Ridiculous.

fcd6b193-8074-4acc-881f-723159e92427,Ryan Bell (Ryan),Don't do your Christmas shopping on this app or with Amazon if you can help it. There's no way to archive the order in app. If you have other Amazon products they will tell your family what you got them for Christmas. Every year I think it's going to be different. Every year I complain. Every year Amazon attempts to tell my wife what she's getting for Christmas. Just nother reason not to shop with this company that treats their lowest paid employees like trash and kills local shops. Buy local!,1,0,20.22.2.100,2020-12-01 20:32:25,20.22.2.100
