Pending items use to always be at the top of the list. Unnecessary organizational updates. Old review: Needs another update this app is glitchy and lags ALL the time. It's so annoying. I can't tell you how many times I scroll down a list only for it to keep sending me back to were I was or images don't load.

Amazon is a joke because Amazon likes to wait almost a week before it takes your money out of your account and then takes it out on the day of delivery which sorry no place does that no one Waits 5 days or more before your money is out of your account knowing when it's ever going to come out of your account before you get your shipment the poor service online and on phone.
