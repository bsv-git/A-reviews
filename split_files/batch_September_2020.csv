16556a98-7274-4163-98e9-3767572e9971,Nathaniel G.,"Awful for digital music. I used to buy a lot of music though Amazon. Like, a lot. They recently made a change where they don't let you preview tracks anymore (trying to push their music service). This makes checking you're buying the right version of a song hard, yet alone discovering new artists. I've also had some issues where my purchase won't download properly and the customer service team questions my intelligence before admitting there is a glitch sometimes and refunds my money.",2,1,20.18.0.100,2020-09-14 03:29:28,20.18.0.100

All you do is go in circles with customer service and then they throw a credit at you but the credit is only good if it's from Amazon and sold by Amazon. That just makes the app pointless. If I'm looking for the cheapest price then obviously it's not going to be from Amazon. Search option is awful.

As i am a prime member of amazon.ae but a soon as i finished selecting the address for delivering the items i had ordered the payment option pop up appeared and as i selected my master card to pay it showed me installments plan option which i selected as 3 month i keyed in my CCV number and few seconds later the order processed and the payment got decline i soon called the amazon.ae help line and reported the matter and guy picked up my call and was ready to help. he said the payment was cancelled and i will have to reorder all my items. I said wat a pity I am a prime subscriber. he said i can help you put all the order in cart again and he did. going to see now that all my ordered items are in cart i was about to press pay now i noticed some variance in my amt to pay from previous. upon checking i found one item form my ordered list the price was shoot up by twice its price. thanks God i didn’t press pay or else i would have ended paying more. i ask the call attended he gave me some defensive answer i told him i understand its not your fault but your company’s servers which are programmed to do this are doing this untruthful act and cheating people. I removed that item and searched for same item again. And I found the item again but still I could not find the same price.
