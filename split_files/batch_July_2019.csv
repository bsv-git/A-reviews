97cb5862-43b6-4ec6-bb3d-ea5bee19c629,A Google user,July 2019. I love Amazon but the app just keeps getting worse. No longer allows infinite scrolling. Places ads at the bottom of pages and requires you to press next. It's getting harder to find what you want because of all the sponsored and less popular stuff being inserted at the top of results. Sorting doesn't work right anymore. I think I'll try to use my computer browser instead of this app from now on. New layout of results makes browsing difficult.,2,1,,2019-07-28 15:53:02,

Rather than adding a toggle for the wishlist at the bottom of the page they removed the wishlist drag and drop feature for everyone. I quite liked seeing my wishlist there and swiping items in it so I can compare them side by side while shopping. now it's something I have to actively open without being able to see it while shopping. I built outfits on there. I hope they bring it back.,1,1,,2019-07-25 03:50:28,

What's annoying is that for a long time now, no-one seems to have bothered to take another look at categorization and filters. Example: I want to look for vinyl records only and want to get there only using categories and filters, but there simply is no way to go to e.g. music and then select vinyl.

If I select price: high to low, it jumps to 863. Then if I actually find something I like, it will advertise one price, then when I select my size, the price can double or triple.
