cc403ff7-e45a-42b4-b77b-95d9d85b6793,Jeff Jackson,I placed 1 order on Black Friday and Amazon locked my account for fraud. Customer service said it's because there were multiple orders in a short time. Amazon split my 1 order into 4 orders and triggered a fraud warning with no chance for me to approve the charges. That is utter stupidity. Update: Just to be safe I called my credit card company. My order has been canceled and will not ship but Amazon is still trying to bill my card for 1 of the 4 orders.,1,0,24.21.4.100,2022-11-26 08:58:15,24.21.4.100
