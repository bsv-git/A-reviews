One in particular is taking away the ability for ebook owners to download they're purchased books i.e. they basically no longer own them. This seems rather similar to the video game purchasing company steam. Where they sell u a license to use said products but not own them. They could simply delete your full library of games at they're own discretion. Is this the situation we should be expecting from amazon too?",3,0,30.3.0.100,2025-02-23 06:26:50,30.3.0.100
