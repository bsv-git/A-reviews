I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the ""category"" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",4,224,20.21.0.100,2020-10-25 16:25:57,20.21.0.100

Why would it not be an automated option to refund/ return EVERY item that your company is responsible for losng? But then upon speaking with two different individuals, they said the only option available to me, if I still wanted my teaching supplies, was a refund and to then use that refund to reorder my items. On items that were ""Prime"" items, to wait four days for them to actually deem them lost, to then waste a day of speaking with people who ultimately couldn't help me, to then be offered the charity to be able to reorder my own items... I am done. I will go to the trouble that it takes to order from other individual companies from now on to NEVER have to go through that again.

No one knows where the package is or when it will be delivered. Contacting customer service to talk to a human is not easy. The chat always redirects to a different page on the app. All to avoid the real issue that they can't deliver on their 2-day shipping policy. So then what am I paying for a Prime account?

d78ab42d-02ac-48d4-a526-251a9a4ed0fb,N M,Amazon collate various editions of the same book into one item but on the app you cannot view all of these. You can only view one hardcover and one paperback edition (all the other hardback and paperback editions are hidden). You have to visit the Amazon website on a desktop computer to view all of these. This makes the app unusable for purchasing books (especially second hand). Please fix this and I'll delete my review. Thank you.,1,113,20.22.0.100,2020-11-10 15:17:41,20.22.0.100

0ae8e31c-733c-4b77-8bb9-fd5a863674b2,Vincent Mascarenhas,Had a Terrible propaganda created by Amazon.AE today while i was ordering few items online having prime delivery. As i am a prime member of amazon.ae but a soon as i finished selecting the address for delivering the items i had ordered the payment option pop up appeared and as i selected my master card to pay it showed me installments plan option which i selected as 3 month i keyed in my CCV number and few seconds later the order processed and the payment got decline i soon called the amazon.ae help line and reported the matter and guy picked up my call and was ready to help. he said the payment was cancelled and i will have to reorder all my items. I said wat a pity I am a prime subscriber. he said i can help you put all the order in cart again and he did. going to see now that all my ordered items are in cart i was about to press pay now i noticed some variance in my amt to pay from previous. upon checking i found one item form my ordered list the price was shoot up by twice its price. thanks God i didn’t press pay or else i would have ended paying more. i ask the call attended he gave me some defensive answer i told him i understand its not your fault but your company’s servers which are programmed to do this are doing this untruthful act and cheating people. I removed that item and searched for same item again. And I found the item again but still I could not find the same price. What a cheater…… Amazon is turned into. what more do we have to go through this pandemic. Never expected companies like Amazon will do something like this to make money.,1,0,20.17.0.100,2020-09-12 18:34:13,20.17.0.100

Recent articles have come to light describing horrible customer service and the blatant use of counterfeit products for many if not most products on the site. Amazon buys from third party vendors and do not check the items or even care whether they're brand-name or fakes and throw them into a pile of items under the same name (so some loser can ship them fake Crest toothpastes and it would be sorted into a pile of real Crest toothpaste) and it's a game of chance what you get.,1,0,16.9.0.100,2020-08-25 16:55:35,16.9.0.100

My son brought it in and of course now knows exactly what he is getting for xmas and has already tried justifying why I should give it to him early.

There's no way to archive the order in app. If you have other Amazon products they will tell your family what you got them for Christmas. Every year I think it's going to be different. Every year I complain. Every year Amazon attempts to tell my wife what she's getting for Christmas. Just nother reason not to shop with this company that treats their lowest paid employees like trash and kills local shops. Buy local!,1,0,20.22.2.100,2020-12-01 20:32:25,20.22.2.100
