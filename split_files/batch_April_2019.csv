Changing the list only last a minute or so, then randomly changes to another list & constantly changes my default list.

I thought I can by pass it by clicking past the ad when it was a sign up sheet. I was hoping to keep that free trial to test out when I really needed it. But no!

9e9170bd-b38f-4589-bda3-3dbfd4bb379b,A Google user,Go to ebay. Amazon has decided to start shipping their own packages. They marked my package as delivered days before i got it and when i asked about it I was told to ask my neighbors and look around the other propeties around my house. When they finally delivered it they delivered it the the community office and not my house. Very annoying and on top of that if you haven't spent $50 in the past 12 months you can't leave reviews.
