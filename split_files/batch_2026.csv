e5ffc3ce-d156-4508-9b93-4b215a80ac09,James,honestly Amazon as a company is a joke. they damage every package they send out. then delay orders by almost a month by changing delivery dates constantly. I've had my order delayed twice due to severe weather that didn't exist then when they realized that wouldn't work they made it a processing error at the warehouse even though my package was out for delivery. now it was due today and they delayed it yet again because of the rain that's nothing but mist. incompetent and lazy defines Amazon,1,85,30.22.2.100,2026-01-01 03:25:10,30.22.2.100
