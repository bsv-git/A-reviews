When on the internet, if I click on any link that goes to Amazon, it DOES NOT open in my browser, it opens in the app. I can see where this might be useful but not as a forced ""feature"".

At times, you see various options available within your criteria, but one you apply a filter, they seem to vanish. Needs work. Filtering by price rage, a basic option on a computer, is not available and is needed to reduce the clutter.

Today I was severely disappointed in this company. They lost my package with 3 items that I need for teaching. They didn't offer the refund/ replacement option for all of my items until I called someone. Why would it not be an automated option to refund/ return EVERY item that your company is responsible for losng? But then upon speaking with two different individuals, they said the only option available to me, if I still wanted my teaching supplies, was a refund and to then use that refund to reorder my items. On items that were ""Prime"" items, to wait four days for them to actually deem them lost, to then waste a day of speaking with people who ultimately couldn't help me, to then be offered the charity to be able to reorder my own items... I am done. I will go to the trouble that it takes to order from other individual companies from now on to NEVER have to go through that again. This wealthy company will not take a hit when it means doing what is right by its customers when it makes a mistake. That is poor customer service.
