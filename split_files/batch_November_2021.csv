It's cheaper, more convenient, and just over all an easier and better experience. The app is constantly freezing, the prices are jacked up way to high, and the delivery fees are crazy. A $2 toy will have an $8 fee just to get it by NEXT WEEK or later. Once, it took nearly a month for a $5 stylus to come.Customer service: inconvenient. For some reason, when I look up $10 crocs, I get $100 shoes! CRAZY!",1,2,,2021-11-30 01:57:48,
