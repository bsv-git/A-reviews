Now bank has to verify via banking app every new sub n save-why-so annoying?!... Love the price slider-much nicer to choose your budget. Gives flexibility to all customers. Generally a good app. Needs a dark mode for people with sight problems-accessibility issue. Sorting doesn't work-end up with a ton of random items from all results/a lot less items than unsorted.

It wouldn't be so much a problem if delivery people followerd instructions to put at front door. they often ignore that instruction amd put at a side door where it goes unnoticed for days if I don't get a delivery notification (which they don't always send) I've lost live plants because they sat in scorching heat for days unnoticed.

702dfb57-452d-42ce-9385-80204efa878f,David Miller,I figured I would give Amazon prime another chance so I did and I made a mistake again. they promised me 2-day delivery sometimes I even saw one day delivery for one thing that I bought and now it says 5 days it'll be here on Thursday and now it's Sunday I ordered it last night that's 6 days or 5 days. I can get that good of delivery time without prime. cancel your prime memberships they are complete waste of time. their customer service stinks. you get your package just as fast without prime.,1,1,24.11.0.100,2025-07-14 07:10:12,24.11.0.100
