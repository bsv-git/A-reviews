97cb5862-43b6-4ec6-bb3d-ea5bee19c629,A Google user,July 2019. I love Amazon but the app just keeps getting worse. No longer allows infinite scrolling. Places ads at the bottom of pages and requires you to press next. It's getting harder to find what you want because of all the sponsored and less popular stuff being inserted at the top of results. Sorting doesn't work right anymore. I think I'll try to use my computer browser instead of this app from now on. New layout of results makes browsing difficult.,2,1,,2019-07-28 15:53:02,

Also I’m going to start a list of every ad on free drive and contact each advertiser and tell them to pull the plug on you.    Furthermore   I don’t see how you think by turning the volume up on ads it will help you sell items because it’s made me so upset that I will never buy a product on any of your commercials    Please do the right thing and just turn the volume down on your commercials that’s all I ask,1,0,18.1.0.100,2019-01-20 03:50:57,18.1.0.100

If you have changed your Payment information or phone number and havent ordered in a while Amazon will require you to call and verify your last card information and old phone number. So if you dont have that information you will not be able to update it or access your account. Hope this helps.,3,2,18.13.2.100,2019-07-13 01:16:07,18.13.2.100
