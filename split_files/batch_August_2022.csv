Handling is irritating if you are used to a real computer for browsing and shopping. Filters lack precision (spamming you with amazons choices but not what you searched for) and options (no functional filter by price). Warning: will NOT require re-authentications. Whoever has access to your phone can do anything !,1,1,20.15.0.100,2022-08-13 12:39:39,20.15.0.100
