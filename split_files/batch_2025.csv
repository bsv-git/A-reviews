You cannot view item details, select other colors, all buying options, etc. Scrolling down just is pillars of other item listings and 'add to cart' buttons.

Not only did they not come but they simply just moved the delivery date and didn't tell me.

So many scammers online these days and Amazon can't be serious about keeping their customers details secure or having one actually have power over a scammer that could potentially be trying to use a browser to dupe people believing it's an Amazon text message and a suspicious link for a delivery.

I can't buy an overpriced yeti cozy selling for over 30$ because someone bought all of them and sells them for over 100$. stop this reseller garbage and let us buy the things we need and want at real prices. instead of lazy resellers ruining our lives. and due to my review Amazon is bullying me by blocking my account. just beware that they are more interested in stealing your dollar than protecting its clients from scams.,1,214,30.17.0.100,2025-09-14 02:08:11,30.17.0.100

It seems that sellers & Amazon both have a problem with shipping dates. You order- it gives you the time frame you're supposed to receive the package and then it's always late. I mean 2-3 days late sometimes. So therefore I stopped ordering items that I need in a day or 2 from amazon- it ain't happening any way! DISAPPOINTING!!!,3,0,,2025-09-12 01:20:32,

I've gotten so many damaged items that I hardly order from Amazon anymore. I got a Blu-ray box set once that was supposed to be about 3 inches depth and it came completely flat like it has been run over by a forklift. seriously why does this keep happening? can we have an option to choose how our items are shipped?,1,4,30.16.0.100,2025-08-30 00:37:07,30.16.0.100

I feel this app is being forced on me by either my phone company or the Amazon company if not both. I never downloaded this app because I do not use it. my phone will not give me a delete option either.

It wouldn't be so much a problem if delivery people followerd instructions to put at front door. they often ignore that instruction amd put at a side door where it goes unnoticed for days if I don't get a delivery notification (which they don't always send) I've lost live plants because they sat in scorching heat for days unnoticed.

702dfb57-452d-42ce-9385-80204efa878f,David Miller,I figured I would give Amazon prime another chance so I did and I made a mistake again. they promised me 2-day delivery sometimes I even saw one day delivery for one thing that I bought and now it says 5 days it'll be here on Thursday and now it's Sunday I ordered it last night that's 6 days or 5 days. I can get that good of delivery time without prime. cancel your prime memberships they are complete waste of time. their customer service stinks. you get your package just as fast without prime.,1,1,24.11.0.100,2025-07-14 07:10:12,24.11.0.100

I find it strange I use the same method to buy this product and somehow the system told me I bought something different.

Everything is AI when you need help and there's some things you need help with and without waiting for hours. A driver has been leaving packages in the totally and obviously wrong place. I have tried to contact a human to get this resolved because I literally watched the driver put packages under the address indicator instead of apartment doors. I have the videos and I have my apartment number on my address for items and my neighbor does too.,2,0,30.9.0.100,2025-05-13 10:14:32,30.9.0.100

This keep happening with others in my unit block this week. I'm at work and can see a photo of it sitting out the front. So now I have to hope that no one takes that. Anyone walking past could tax it. My street is quite busy foot traffic. Guess we hope it's still there in a few hours,2,6,30.7.0.100,2025-04-17 04:26:53,30.7.0.100

f76c089b-06e3-42e6-bf83-e34fbee4bda3,Andrea Williams,I am giving a 2 star due to Rufus not only being added but for not being able to disable it. It comes up on your screen every time you click something and no matter what you are not able to hide it completely so it covers small portions of the screen which on a Samsung device you may need to click on some of the things it covers and the meer fact you can't disable it and no other option is ridiculous! Update STILL hate Rufus can't disable. Please change design back. The color DESIGN CHOICE 👎,2,10,30.6.0.100,2025-04-02 04:27:49,30.6.0.100

ab2eb9af-a464-4d91-afc8-4950ab6f1fc3,Guillermo lozada,I am recently having a really bad experience with Amazon prime shipping. I'm paying Amazon prime each month without me even buying from Amazon and when I do they are always late or they have to reschedule my delivery for the next day. If it's something random there ain't no problem with that. But when I do need something important for me that's where the problem is. I don't know who's the problem if the company or the drivers but in Riverside county Ca. I'm always getting my packages late,1,0,30.4.0.100,2025-03-14 03:16:59,30.4.0.100

In less than a year they close my card with no warning and claim I was a credit risk after I paid and did nothing but earn my store card by perfect payment history. Amazon lost my business.

It's not ok nor feasible for you to charge me when I order to take a week to finally charge my account and attempt to take the money a second time. If you place an order you take the money immediately because ppl buy things now to not have to worry bout it taking a couple of days. Amazon is not important like Gas or electricity or car bills. It's bs when my stuff if you choose to send it I'll be deleting this app I'll use everything else even if more money,1,0,30.4.0.100,2025-03-10 07:47:05,30.4.0.100

Finger memory at this point and not only am I clicking the wrong things, but it's really hard to navigate to get to where you need. I'm not sure if that's on purpose or not so that you can't find some things, like subscribe and save, but I don't like it. It feels a bit cluttered and unintuitive, navigation wise. Super confusing.

They made everything not intuitive; there is one button i the middle for everything making it more than one tap for things that used to be one. Getting to purchases and account settings is far more confusing than it used to be. Still no dark mode in 2025!

Prime is not an advantage any more since they are completely unable to deliver anything on time anymore and the next day and 2 day delivery are complete lies and a joke.

This is a power hungry app and the bright white screen doesn't help.

Amazon can easily take your money but they don't really care if your order actually gets delivered.

09570ba2-c7fa-4e7a-bd3d-eddd7891cbb6,Luke Stowe,Worst retail website ever. I ordered an A1 Poster frame and a A4 frame only to get a email later off Amazon saying my both packages have both being canceled without any explanation why. Not only that but they took my money for both items and I won't get the money back in 5-6 working days. What an absolute joke of a company ran by simply indivduals.,1,0,,2025-01-10 14:20:38,

f76c089b-06e3-42e6-bf83-e34fbee4bda3,Andrea Williams,I am giving a 2 star due to Rufus not only being added but for not being able to disable it. It comes up on your screen every time you click something and no matter what you are not able to hide it completely so it covers small portions of the screen which on a Samsung device you may need to click on some of the things it covers and the meer fact you can't disable it and no other option is ridiculous!

The only ones who benefit is amazon & china. 2) prime video was 100% ad-free, now they expect members to pay $2.99 for it to be ad-free. WTAF My solution is to buy local whenever possible.
