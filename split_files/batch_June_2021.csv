It's extremely difficult to search products by a specific category since many of them are burried deep inside other less relevant categories. Filtering is also a mess. There's no way to choose a specific price range and/or multiple brands. In addition, it's impossible to leave the seller's feedback after purchasing(!). Overall, it is usable, but sometimes it's easier to switch to a desktop browser...",3,2,20.22.4.100,2021-06-28 18:02:26,20.22.4.100

Amazon being the largest retailer in the world have done just that, they should change it back, but of course they won't.

I don't like the menus being on the bottom and the entire thing is repetitive in where the menus and buttons go.
