Please leave an option for looking only at, say, one star reviews for products. Generally speaking negative reviews usually offer some insight for what may be a problem with a product and I find them to be very useful for determining if it is right for me. I would appreciate it if you would add a filter to only show these reviews when I want to, as it will help me better determine if a product is a good fit. Thanks for your time. If this already exists in the app, please tell me via a comment reply. Thank you",4,4,16.19.0.100,2018-10-15 01:12:41,16.19.0.100

Recently their prices have went up but their service has fell through the basement-Piss Poor!!! I have recieved several damaged packages, and purposely generic not as advertised products as well as damaged products. My last 3 orders in a row, in a week's time were all delayed and in addition I also had a total cancellation. Needless to say they did not meet their Mandatory Guaranteed two day shipping promise. I had to go through 3 or 4 people each time in customer service after constant rude disconnections and 3 failed promises to be called back/contacted to get the same false promises of immediately correcting and expedited my order..etc and how it wont happen again....for the 3rd time! Then far as the compensation goes I was offered a mere petty $5 promo each time and after I told them that is beyond under enough for the 3rd time they told me that was their max!?😡🤬 All in all I missed dates for which I was buying gifts for people as well as vital necessities I needed for myself, I would not recommend you waste your money on this faulty false-advertising service through a company that over charges and doesn't value their loyal customers. I personally would recommend Walmart, they are free and you receive your orders timely! Dont waste your money or precious time and peace of mind with the headache and false claims of Amazon.
