I say this because multiple times have my electronic related products end up undeliverable with no explanation until I talk to one of their many robot employees that always tell me your items got delayed due to them being damaged. Then they say sorry we can't do anything and always want you to request a refund that takes 3 weeks this happened to me multiple time.,1,1,28.4.0.100,2024-03-08 17:14:34,28.4.0.100

They will say they delivered the package with a picture of it in the weeds and nobody came to my house all day. Then they will say they couldn't deliver due to not being able to access house when nobody came to my house that day.
