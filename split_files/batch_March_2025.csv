I use Amazon in Canada and US, but 95% in US. the app keeps giving me notifications for The Canadian site requiring me to go into my orders, change to Canada site, check notifications, and go back to US. I've disabled all notifications but the activity persists.",2,0,30.6.0.100,2025-03-31 13:16:10,30.6.0.100

They don't pay their workers enough and rely too much on automation and AI. Prime fees keep going up and you get less and less.

I was looking for a way to contact Amazon. Ask for if the money that was taken off for order I didn't make. Could be put on order I do want to make. 3/10/2025 U should discount us on order not arriving in time. Ur app says on day or out for delivery. Then changes to days later. U dnt have same day delivery on everything. Now nothing shows up in time.,3,0,30.4.0.100,2025-03-10 12:11:40,30.4.0.100

People shouldn't have to re-learn an app to find things that were easy to locate. I get that you want people to find new things they didn't know were there but that's not going to happen when the person just wants to look up one thing. Just like going to the grocery store and finding every ile in the store moved and now that trip that you only had 15 min takes 30 minutes. Smh,1,0,30.4.0.100,2025-03-06 02:50:44,30.4.0.100

They made everything not intuitive; there is one button i the middle for everything making it more than one tap for things that used to be one. Getting to purchases and account settings is far more confusing than it used to be. Still no dark mode in 2025!
