That's like saying let's if you have the money at the time of order and we ll wait 2 weeks and we still want to have that same money available that we charged you for but yet the order is placed but not charged.

I am happy with my order. but I am not very happy about not getting to use the rest of my Amazon gift card Balance on another order. this needs to be fixed. you shouldn't have to keep ordering other items that you don't want just to get you order or have to sign up for a Amazon prime account or credit card just to order from Amazon. that is just like forcing someone to buy things they don't want. please fix it . thanks,2,0,30.6.0.100,2025-04-04 08:46:39,30.6.0.100

f3bc5fd4-c628-440f-aa50-e49923a851b8,Nikunj ayar,"I recently placed my first order with Amazon after they left Quebec, and it was a terrible experience. Instead of attempting to deliver my package, they simply took it back and asked me to pick it up from Canada Post. No delivery attempt, no notice—just an unnecessary hassle. What’s the point of paying for home delivery if I have to go pick it up myself? I am extremely disappointed with the service. Amazon’s delivery in Montreal has become unreliable, and I doubt I’ll order again.",1,0,30.6.0.100,2025-04-01 11:44:36,30.6.0.100
