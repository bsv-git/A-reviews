Cons: the search is extremely basic and often turns up irrelevant goods. There is no advanced search at all. You can't narrow your search by price range, brand, country of manufacture, rating level, or anything. Worst of all: for people who want to buy from democracies, there are goods, but it's very hard to find them or confirm where they are made.",2,0,20.8.0.100,2022-01-04 17:59:25,20.8.0.100

9f14eb50-7268-483d-9f1a-ca9d999443e1,Brooke Kaminski,I have been an Amazon customer for 17 years. I started by buying books in college. Over the last six month I have noticed that they have started to treat everyone poorly. The merchants their employees and even their customers. They have changed their policy to having to return most items that have arrived damaged or even if you order something and it doesn't show and have them replace it. If the item still shows you are responsible for returning the item or you get charged for both. I had a horrible experience today with customer service and trying to get a shipping label. UPS has to bring one to my door in order for me to return it. I currently have a house full of people with COVID and choose to have it picked up from my house to avoid human contact and yet I still have to talk to someone to receive a label I could normally print off at home because my package arrived with the products inside not packaged correctly and broken. The customer service person was not helpful and didn't really listen to what I was saying and kept repeating herself without actually answering the question. I am so frustrated I want to cancel my Prime membership. I feel like the company should be more cooperative and there should be a way for us to prove something is damaged without having to return a broken product to the warehouse. I get that they want to resell a bunch of their returns. But honestly is it worth putting UPS and USPS through all that when they are only the middle men? It seems such a waste of resources.
