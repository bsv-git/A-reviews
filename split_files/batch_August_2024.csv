They let me believe shipping is covered (for the sake of clarity I've always chosen the cheapest/free shipping option) then charge me. They also add tips (WTfreakinF!!?) for the drivers with my money. They've decided what the tip should be before service has ever taken place. That's a scam! Upon review Amazon prices are higher than average!! DONT USE THIS!!",1,0,28.6.0.100,2024-08-31 18:57:10,28.6.0.100

No fighting crowds, can do it in my jammies or boxers, don't have to go out in rain/heat/freezing weather, carry it all over a store, or deal with rude people!! I LOVE THIS!!! Downsides? 1) Loss/breakage 2) you can't examine the products. 3) it's ENTIRELY too easy to spend a paycheck very quickly! 😁 I rely on this quite a bit.

I remember items being late was rare. Now, having items come on time is getting to be rare, and it seems like the reps hands are tied tighter with every phone call. The reason I have 3 stars instead of 2 is the number of products that are available. If I were in charge of shipping, I would definitely find a solution I 100% guarantee better results",3,0,28.14.2.100,2024-08-06 13:12:38,28.14.2.100

If this is a business that is trying to facilitate my needs I should have the option not to have Sunday delivery. I also cannot see all of the price changes because you only give a one-time auction and it's impossible to find things that go on sale unless you get them on that one single screen because you get rid of both the scrolling bar and the table.,2,0,28.14.2.100,2024-08-04 17:07:28,28.14.2.100
