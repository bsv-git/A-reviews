The following issues happen every time the app is dysfunctional: Can't search items because the screen freezes, items in the ""save for later"" area won't populate to the cart when prompted. When you finally are able to search an item, the appearance of the list is super large. You can't search for anything. You can't buy anything.

I really enjoyed the previous menu filter which opened on the right side, taking up maybe half the screen when you open it, and it had everything listed on its own line. Now the filters are grouped together, taking up the whole screen. The other way felt more fluid and easier to identify than trying to find a certain filter in a paragraph of little boxes :/",3,544,26.13.6.100,2023-07-09 23:31:00,26.13.6.100

Between paying the ridiculous price for Prime and orders not arriving on time or if at all and vendors advertising they have an item and then they don't is just plain ridiculous!

The ""my orders"" page only lists the last few items purchased, and then you have to filter instead of just being able to scroll through all your purchases. The filter window is not working for me, will not let me select any of the parameters, and freezes, and it is impossible to find my previous orders.
