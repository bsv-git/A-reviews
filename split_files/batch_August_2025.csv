I ended up having to use my phone to search Amazon as I prefer it to the full website. I just replaced my kindle fire with a samsung galaxy tablet, it's great to have the Amazon app back, its just so easy to use. After using it for 3 days, Rufus has stopped working, giving a time-out message. I have no idea why becaus tablet and app are up to date, I have force stopped the app and restarted my tablet.
