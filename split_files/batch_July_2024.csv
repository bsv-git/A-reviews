Amazon isn't cheap, but they're fast, that's why you choose it over cheaper alternatives, but lately all they've done is mess up deliveries, so I wouldn't bother. They don't compensate, or solve the issue they just say they'll get it to you when they can. My driver was 2 stops away and close to me, he completely buggered off so far in the opposite direction.

ddcf37b1-6b1c-4702-a5d8-b82d3142a90a,eyezwisey,The overall experience w/ Amazon's services is that I can shop for every holiday and find just about anything. Amazon is a concierge service that's annoying to retailers. It's a businesses revolution. I just notice prime video isn't giving free video watch with trials. That's out of control in my opinion that's why I didn't give 5 stars. Whole foods is a extra plus if you need to grocery shop. I appreciate Amazon prime and don't really mind not being subscribed because I spend alot anyway.,4,0,28.13.6.100,2024-07-23 12:34:12,28.13.6.100

The 2 day shipping is a lie, and pretty much the only reason people pay for Amazon prime is the two day shipping.

Switching between Amazon and any other app will make me lose my place which is incredibly frustrating. The app and website are both incredibly overbloated with basic features like wish lists being hidden because Amazon would rather strongarm users into buying something or anything as opposed to actually helping them have a good experience.,1,87,28.13.6.100,2024-07-15 17:20:19,28.13.6.100

Right now I got screwed from someone from China which I didn't know that the seller was located in China. Since the seller is out of Amazon's district I won't get a refund from the seller. If the item is being sold by a sponsor I will not buy the item. The item is shipped by Amazon then I'll buy it. I'm tired getting screwed by people.,1,7,28.13.6.100,2024-07-15 16:03:30,28.13.6.100

Locker pick ups don't work. The app doesn't load the next step. Absolutely absurd that a company this big placed lockers in several locations just for the app to not work when trying to pick up at the locker. Returns are difficult and you have to package items even when it says you don't.,1,51,28.13.6.100,2024-07-13 18:25:38,28.13.6.100

I ordered a mattress, bed frame and bed sheets from Amazon AU. I had the worst experience. They charged but only delivered the bed frame and bed sheet without the mattress. I asked CS many times. They told me to wait for their email when they have stock. But they never told me how long to wait and when will they ship the product.
