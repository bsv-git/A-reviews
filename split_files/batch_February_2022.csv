As of last week, the app keeps switching to French and no matter how many times I click the English option and save (i have to Google how to change the language setting, since its not even possible to find thr setting in app), it either half translates or doesn't save my preference.

4fcfac8c-ba2f-4bbe-806f-ade772ea4459,Reets Lee,App is fine to use for shopping and browsing. The main suggestions I have for improvements are: 1: The app needs a way for customer to mark an order as received. Delivery times for me have been super fast but because the order status can't be updated from 'on the way' I keep getting emails apologising for the delay for items I've already received. 2: It's hard to find the help chat within the app and chat is lost if window is left. 3: Better search function for items shipped from Australia.,4,9,22.22.2.100,2022-02-26 20:57:54,22.22.2.100
