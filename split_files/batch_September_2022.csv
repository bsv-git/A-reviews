You aren't able to select multiple items if you want to move more than one thing to another list. So you have to go through item by item to move them BUT it shoots you back up to the very top of the wish list. Scrolling back down to where you left off (and the placeholder not being automatically removed after you've moved an item) is pretty annoying after a while.,3,267,24.16.0.100,2022-09-03 16:58:08,24.16.0.100
