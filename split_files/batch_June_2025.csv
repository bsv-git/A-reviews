A search for a specific item is useless- not the item or size or color or brand I specifically searched for. Still no dark mode for the App. Added complexity, confusion and complication in simply accessing orders or subscriptions. Useless Rufus still takes up precious screen space. 'AI' generated review synopses are a waste of time and screen space. Overall, the app keeps getting worse with each iteration.",2,2,30.10.0.100,2025-06-01 11:52:52,30.10.0.100
