Some Amazon returns have a $10 restocking fee in which didn't start until a few months ago when I learned the hard way. Second is my biggest concern or complaint. This OTC is annoying and I didn't even know how to find it since I couldnt access my email. You have to search message center in search box and pull up all messages JUST to find it or no item you get.,2,0,28.21.0.100,2024-10-31 11:30:34,28.21.0.100

Since then I have realised that there is nothing more satisfying than Amazon prime because....I GET MY ITEMS SO FAST. I have actually never been disappointed by them. Maybe one day but not today. I unsubscribed from PRIME because I thought It would be fine..it wasn't. I am having to wait several days for my package. Prime comes so quickly and the packages are so exciting to get.

The Amazon customer care executives when asked for the delivery agent's phone number they send some completely different delivery agent's number who doesn't even has any deliveries with my name.

53f8562b-e4ac-4f2c-b37c-2b7289ac2eea,Sacara T,Man I use to love Amazon until they opened up a warehouse here on Oahu. They literally hold packages for a little over a week at their warehouse here which is freaking ridiculous because I've never had this issue before they opened their warehouse here on the island. I can't say it's the sellers because it's not it's literally the workers in the Oahu warehouse that is delaying packages. I understand packages get delayed but over a week while just sitting in the warehouse is ridiculous.🙄🤦🏽‍♀️,2,1,,2024-10-07 00:38:28,

You need a button to report fraud and listings that keep previous reviews for a different product. I need to scroll thru pics go back to the old way already. sketchy that you don't allow screenshots on the purchase page or screen recordings so somehow my entire gift card balance whas used.
