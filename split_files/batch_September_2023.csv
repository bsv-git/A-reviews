Amazon's greed is ridiculous, it shouldn't take 5 clicks for EACH subscription to be skipped or canceled...if I'm having a month where I can't afford all the extras, I should be able to select all & skip...

When I try all the different options, just show up as white blocks. I've cleared the cache, force stop, removed the app and added back, restarted my phone, and still nothing happened.

It would be one thing if they brought back the 2-3 day shipping. Or heck, even kept the 5 day shipping.

They think that it improves the one handed experience but it leaves your hand further away from the auto complete suggestions which is more inconvenient. I'd much rather the option to move the search bar than be forced to have it at the bottom when every other app and site has it at the top. It's not original or unique. It's solely an inconvenient especially when the browser keeps it at the top. It's not a feature but a drawback.,1,541,26.17.2.100,2023-09-14 00:57:32,26.17.2.100

It's clearly gotten more complicated to return items, and it's ""disguised as convenience"" with the number of options that they give you to return things. It's become so complicated to discern between label/no label QR/ no QR, Box/No Box that you ultimately go to the UPS store 3 times to get it right.

Recently though, I've noticed Amazon no longer delivers the items when promised - even with prime. My last few orders have been delayed during transit.

Simple modifications like changing delivery address for already purchased units leave you cycling in a loop without being able to find where to update the information. Even finding the place to modify your payment details is difficult which is weird considering these are important features that should be easy to find and modify,2,14,26.18.4.100,2023-09-27 09:15:50,26.18.4.100
c3de6a21-09f3-4b24-a550-8b9e69d4ebd0,Steven M-W,According to Amazon employees they require you to change your password every 8 months. They claim its for their customers but trying to make a new password that is easy to remember is very difficult for some people. You also can't use an old password which makes the while thing that much harder. So by doing this Amazon is assuring that their customers will have to practice unsafe password habits such as writing them down. Also the customer service is a mix of friendly people and horrible people,1,0,22.22.8.100,2023-09-22 15:32:55,22.22.8.100
