Then ill look from someone else's account and see the original price I saw prior to me actually adding the item to my cart. They are bait and switch. I know some items are priced differently based off of the size but then sometimes they just switch items.

And then was told from another representative the opposite. I thought Amazon lived up to there word. Apparently they can say one thing to us. Then say the complete opposite a few days later. Amazon does not live up to there word. This how they want to treat us. I have MS. So Amazon is what I depend on. On what I can get on there website! 😔 Amazon must be Money hungry!
