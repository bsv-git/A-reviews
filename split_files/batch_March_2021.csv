Search is basic to the point you can hardly narrow down without going through hoops. Receipt is a hunting trip as there isn't an automatic generated one unless you open your email and look at each item shipped individually. And the new updated icon is horrendous. I don't know who sat there and said this is the logo but for the love of God fire it and get a better logo designer. 🙌,2,8,22.5.0.100,2021-03-08 13:06:09,22.5.0.100
