New layout is clunky, unintuitive, and doesn't work like the old one did. This seems like change just for change's sake vs a real attempt to improve the app. 9 times out of 10 you'll learn that's a pretty stupid reason to change something. Take the hint Amazon.

Instead of respecting the device font size and screen magnification settings, Amazon has its own fixed font minimum sizes. So if your device is set to large fonts, and the screen magnification is set to larger, then unlike every other app in existence, this one has massive fonts in some places, normal fonts in others, and it cuts off buttons in the app because they're not properly adaptive.",3,22,22.7.0.100,2021-04-04 16:05:19,22.7.0.100

1067b7cb-cb1e-4446-8654-9a1655db1cf3,Lissy Estes,Overall I love Amazon and the convenience of shopping and returns. I'd say 95% of the time customer service is extremely helpful. Over the years I've come across a few who either don't know their job (maybe new employee) or don't care about their job. I've only had 1 bad experience with customer service that made me question whether I'd continue the service. I've used Amazon shopping app to shop for the last few years and have never had trouble with it.,5,30,22.7.0.100,2021-04-07 21:41:31,22.7.0.100

But when you search for something you still have to switch on prime even if you selected prime. Next to home is your ordrers and buy again but they are displayed oddly. Your not yet delivered items are at the top but your most recent purchases are at the bottom. I liked the old way they sorted purchases and upcoming deliveries. 500 character limit - 1 star,1,16,22.7.0.100,2021-04-10 13:17:06,22.7.0.100
